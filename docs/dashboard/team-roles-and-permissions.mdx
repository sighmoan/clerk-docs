**Clerk Dashboard** offers various roles to manage team members' access. Different roles ensure that team members have the appropriate level of access according to their responsibilities. The Clerk Dashboard is divided into four different roles, each with its own set of permissions and capabilities. These roles are designed to balance security and flexibility, allowing all team members to have the right level of access to the resources they need.
