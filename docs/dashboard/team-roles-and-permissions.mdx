Clerk Dashboard offers various roles to manage team members access. Different roles ensure that team members have the appropriate level of access according to their responsibilities.
The Clerk Dashboard is divided in 4 different roles, each with its own set of permissions and capabilities. These roles were designed to provide a balance between security and flexibility, allowing all the different team members to have the right level of access to the resources they need.

-   **Admin**: Has the highest level of control, with comprehensive access and management capabilities across all team and application settings. Admins can read and manage user and organization data, manage applications, developer resources, and API keys, as well as have read access to billing information.
-   **Developer**: Focuses on development tasks with the ability to manage developer resources and read user and organization data. Developers also have read access to billing information but do not have management permissions for users, organizations, applications, or API keys.
-   **Support**: Primarily responsible for user and organization support. Support roles can read user and organization data, manage user data (including impersonating and banning users), and have read access to billing information. They do not manage applications, developer resources, or API keys.
-   **Member**: Has basic access with read-only permissions for user and organization data, as well as billing information. Members cannot manage any settings or resources.

Refer to the permissions that each role provides mapped to Dashboard resources:
